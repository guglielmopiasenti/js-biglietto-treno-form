# Second part

The program must: ask the name and age and km to travel, on the base of these informations it must provide the correct price to pay, and if there are discounts available, to provide them.

## MILESTONE 1:

We start by implementing the program without any aesthetics: using exclusively two inputs and a button (not stylized), we implement the specifications written above. The final response (or output) will also be written in the console.

## MILESTONE 2:

Only once milestone 1 is complete and functional will we create a form (not <form> tag) on ​​the page where the user can enter data and view the final calculation with the price.
The data recap and the final price output will then be printed on the page (the price must be formatted with a maximum of two decimals, to indicate the cents on the price).

## PROCEDURE

1. I get the input and button elements from the DOM
2. I create an event listener for the button so that it can read the inputs from targeted inputs
3. I get the previous calculation and I connect it to the new elements
4. I create a form element in the DOM.
5. I connect the Form to the input and button elements so that i can show the info and price information.
6. Adding randomized elements
