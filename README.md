# Exercise procedure

The program must calculate the price of the train ticket based on the amount of km and the passenger's age.
Based on this information, he will have to calculate the total price of the trip, according to these rules:

- the ticket price is defined on the basis of km (€0.21 per km)
- a 20% discount is applied for underage users
- a 40% discount should be applied for over 65s.
  The output of the final price must be entered with a maximum of two decimals, to indicate cents on the price.

## Steps:

1. Targeting an element in the DOM.
2. Asking the user how many km he needs to travel and saving it.
3. Calculating price per km and saving it.
4. Asking the user's age and saving it.
5. Insert discount age variable for underage (20%) and over 65 (40%) users.
6. Calculate price based on previous info (eliminate calculation for more than 2 decimals).
7. Print result of the calculation on the choosen element.

### Bonuses

1. Print price on screen instead of console.
2. Add more info on the web page describing price before discount; age and km indicated by the user.
3. Validation
4. Embellishing page with CSS.

# Second part

the program now gets more complex:
the prompts must be turned into inputs always visible and the program should also ask the name of the passengere, so that later it can display it inside of a fake ticket fac-simile.

## MILESTONE 1:

We start by implementing the program without any aesthetics: using exclusively two inputs and a button (not stylized), we implement the specifications written above. The final response (or output) will also be written in the console.

## MILESTONE 2:

Only once milestone 1 is complete and functional will we create a form (not <form> tag) on ​​the page where the user can enter data and view the final calculation with the price.
The data recap and the final price output will then be printed on the page (the price must be formatted with a maximum of two decimals, to indicate the cents on the price).

## PROCEDURE

1. I get the input elements from the DOM
2.
3.
